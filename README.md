# news_scraper

> Easly get an overlook of what topics are published around the world.

**This project is still under construction**

The ideal of this project is to get the data from various news scrapers ( gnp, newspaper ), to be able to map the prevalance of publish topics around the world. For example, if Ghana publishes a lot of articles about water, then, on a map, it will appear for example darker than Canade, where few articles are published.

This project is supposed to work in tandem with news_mapper, which is a website that feeds on the data of news_scraper.
